## üßæOverview

This introductory course focuses on statistical techniques commonly used in
social work and the social sciences. This course will equip students with knowledge
of the role of quantitative analyses in social work research and its relationship
to other components of the research process. Content in the course will be
related to topics studied in students‚Äô research methods and theory courses. We
focus on acquiring the skills necessary to conduct quality research and learn
the basics of presenting information to facilitate informed decision making.

Students will learn how to interpret, conduct and present descriptive and inferential
statistical analyses in a data science framework. Students will gain skills
to (a) independently manage data files and prepare variables for analysis; (b)
match statistical procedures to research questions and hypotheses, and (c) conduct
and interpret results of basic statistical procedures. Emphasis will be given
to contemporary issues related to social work by exploring the three elementary
areas of: (1) description; (2) inference; and (3) correlation as they apply
to examples and case studies that emphasize the use of data and statistics to
solve real world problems in a social justice framework. The course will focus
on the application of skills using SPSS, R and JASP and on the
reporting of findings from analyses.

Basic and common statistical procedures covered will include t-tests, ANOVAs,
ANCOVAs, correlations/covariances, and crosstab chi-square tests and nonparametric
procedures corresponding to some of these analyses. Students will
obtain the skills necessary to conduct power analyses for the procedures covered
as well to compute analysis-specific effect sizes. The course will end with
a brief introduction to regression analysis.
